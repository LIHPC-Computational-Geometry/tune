# Topologic UntaNgling 2D mEsher

The aim of this project is to provide an environment to implement 
Reinforcement Learning algorithms that aim to topologically
modify a 2D mesh. More specifically, we implement the work of 
*A. Narayanana*, *Y. Pan*, and *P.-O. Persson*, which is described 
in "**Learning topological operations on meshes with application to 
block decomposition of polygons**" (see [arxiv article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06484.pdf)
and [presentation](http://tetrahedronvii.cimne.com/slides/Persson.pdf)).
