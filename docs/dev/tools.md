# Some development tips

## Tools to use

In order to contribute to this project, we suggest to download and/or use:
- [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as a Python IDE. The community edition is sufficient for this project;
- Python 3 and some python packages like numpy and pygame;
- To draw pictures, you can use the version of [Excalidraw](https://math.preview.excalidraw.com) that integrates LateX
support;
- The documentation is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org). To complete the documentation, you can
add content in the [documentation directory](../../docs), and the documentation website will be updated when a branch 
is merged in the main branch of **tune**. If you want to see the documentation in your own computer, you can use
the `mkdocs serve` command (see [here](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/) for a first example).

## Github procedure
We use merge/pull request to accept contributions. In other words, if you want to contribute to the **tune** project, 
you have to develop in your own branch and ask for a merge request onto the main branch.
